# E-commerce customer Churn Analysis ans Pridiction

![alt text](image.png)

##  Introduction
ML can predict when a customer is likely to churn (stop using the platform) based on their behavior. Identifying potential churners allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers.
<br>
Guidelines for Churn Prediction:
<br>
Define churn indicators: Identify key factors that indicate a customer might churn, such as a decrease in usage, a lapse in subscriptions, or negative feedback.
<br>
Build predictive models: Utilize classification algorithms like logistic regression or decision trees to predict churn probabilities.
<br>
Implement retention strategies: Develop targeted campaigns or offers to re-engage at-risk customers.
<br>
Monitor and iterate: Continuously assess the effectiveness of your churn prediction model and refine it as new data becomes available.

## Goal

Build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at risk of leaving the company (churn) based on the provided variables. This can help the company take proactive steps to retain these customers and reduce the rate of churn.

<br>
Perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the provided customer data to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of the customers. This includes analyzing patterns and trends in variables. This analysis can help the company understand its customers better and inform future decision-making.
